        Long ago, a poor man was working on the landlord's field. One day, the
        lord saw the man working hard and said to him, Why don't you get up from
        my land and move to better land? The man looked up and replied, When I
        die, Lord, I will move to better land than this. The lord understood the
        message and began treating his workers better.
